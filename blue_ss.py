NAME: BlueSS
BY:
    Some Guy they call Scooter
    Common Sense Cyber Group

Created: 11/12/2021
Updated: 11/12/2021

Version: 1.0.1

License: MIT


Purpose:
    -This is a POC script to test out the functionality of pyBlueIris to see how we can control a BlueIris CCTV Server
    -It could also be manually run from the cli for any ad-hoc commands/control that may be needed
    -This script was initially be used as a module in a larger security system program suite in order to interact with BlueIris based on events/alrms from that security system

Considerations:
    -This is just a POC script that is being tested on a BlueIris 4 Server Install on Windows 10
        -This has NOT been tested on BlueIris 5 but should work
    -Arguments need to be entered from the user for the username, password, host, protocol, and command to keep this script from hardcoding anything that may be compormised
    -Python 3.6+ is required for this script

Arguments:
    --The process for invoking this script: 'python blue_ss.py -hn <host> -p <protocol> -u <user> -t <token> -c <command> -a <command args>'
        -This would be: 'python3 blue_ss.py -hn 192.168.1.2 -p http -u admin -t password123 -c list_cameras
        -Note that some commands may take additional arguments to get the expected result! Refer to the README in order to determine when to use these 

To Do:
    -See if we are able to use HTTPS for this....
    -Set up more error checking
    -Set up more logging

### IMPORT LIBRARIES ###
import logging      #https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/logging.html - Used to log errors and other script information
import pyblueiris   #https://pypi.org/project/pyblueiris/ - Used to interface with BlueIris
from aiohttp import ClientSession   #https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/aiohttp.html - This is for making the connection to the BlueIris server (in this script's case, localhost)
import argparse     #https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/argparse.html - Used for parsing through arguments handed to the script


### DEFINE VARIABLES ###

#Set up logging for user activities
logging_file = "blue_ss.log"         #Define log file location for windows
logger = logging.getLogger('blue_ss CCTV Script Log')  #Define log name
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)              #Set logger level
fh = logging.FileHandler(logging_file)      #Set the file handler for the logger
fh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)                  #Set the file handler log level
logger.addHandler(fh)                       #Add the file handler to logging
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')   #Format how the log messages will look
fh.setFormatter(formatter)                  #Add the format to the file handler
