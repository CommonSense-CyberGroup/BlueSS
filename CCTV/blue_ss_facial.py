Purpose:
    -The purpose of this script is to run facial and human recognition on alerts and recordings from the BlueIris CCTV System
    -Upon seeing a face (positive ID or unknown) or a human body, an alert will be sent to the configured list of recipients via Email
    -This script was built intended to be used in Windoes, buut is written in such a way that it should work on most platforms

Considerations:
    -The Haar Cascade and LBP models are used in this script for recognition. We use DLIB in order to create our dataset to run a face againse
        *DLIB IS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THIS SCRIPT AND WE USE A PRE-PROCESSED FILE FOR EVERYTHING AS THIS CAN TAKE A LONG TIME*

To Do:
    -
